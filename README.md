<h1>Alien RPG System</h1>
Official system for playing the ENNIE award winning Alien RPG by Free League on Foundry VTT. <br /><br />
Free League have now officially endorsed the system and we have been working to provide official content to enhance the system (see below).

See the Journal Entry "MO/TH/ER Instructions" for an overview on how to use the system and it's features.
<br /><br />
The core system provides support for:

  <ul>
    <li>Including the ability to drag and drop Items, Talents, Agendas and Story Cards.</li>

    <li>Armor - Personal armor</li>
    <li>Talent - Talents for use within the system</li>

  </ul>

Should you wish to populate the system with game content for your own use please purchase the rules from Free League Publishing: <a href="https://frialigan.se/en/games/alien/">Free League - Alien RPG</a> or better still purchase the Starter Set or Core Rules modules. <br /><br />

My intention is to enable people to play Alien RPG remotely and not to create a fully enabled/automated system. MO/TH/ER will still need to do some work. <br /><br /> <b>Official Modules:</b><br /> Save the effort of inputting all the data from the books by purchasing the official modules from Free League: <br />
